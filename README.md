# Radio Quadrature Mixer  
**Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Design: Implemented Filters, Limiters, and Mixers (Best Design)**

## Project Overview

The Radio Quadrature Mixer project focused on the design and implementation of filters, limiters, and mixers within a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) framework. This project involved rigorous testing and refinement phases to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Full Project Presentation below.

## Launching Phase

### Debugging PCB using Voltage Probes  
In this phase, I ensured proper signal flow and identified any discrepancies within the circuitry. Using precision voltage probes, I tested critical points for stable performance.
